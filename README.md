# ColonCancerPytorchViT
implements a Vision Transformer model for your COAD dataset using Pytorch ViT

This model uses a video transformer and Hugging Face transformers and timm library

I still need to convert my data to fit this version of the model. I think I will try it on the hyperkvasir dataset instead.

I downloaded the hyperkvasir dataset and set up the file format for training a pytorch ViT model. 56gb

The goal of this model will be to build a vision transformer for lesion detection, polyp characterization, and fibrosis grading.

First, a lot of work went into the data loader to get the data into python.
