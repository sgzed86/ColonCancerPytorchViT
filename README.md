# ColonCancerPytorchViT
implements a Vision Transformer model for your COAD dataset using Pytorch ViT

This model uses a video transformer and Hugging Face transformers and timm library

I still need to convert my data to fit this version of the model. I think I will try it on the hyperkvasir dataset instead.
